Notes:
=============================
- return null for void types
- outranks method in Competitor
  - outranks.size increases in a for loop
    - hence the invariants and halting measure needs to be documented
- createComplist in Competitor1
  - could have added first and second, why check all conditions ?
  - compList can be set not a list
